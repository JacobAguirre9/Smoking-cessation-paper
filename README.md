Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2022). Every year, almost five million people worldwide die prematurely from smoking. Smokers are at an increased risk of a number of non-lethal illnesses, including cataracts, Crohnâ€™s disease, depression, Type 2 diabetes, impotence, visual impairment, osteoporosis and tuberculosis. In market places, consumers continue to obtain information necessary to making a rational decision regarding usage of cigarettes, but place low value on following through on smoking cessation methods. A study conducted in 2018 found that more than $55\%$ of active smokers attempted a quit in the past year. The end goal for the smokers who wish to quit is to secede from continuous smoking and turn to alternative methods to help wean off of nicotine slowly. Often, this is due to users having levels of addiction that require treatment to be fast, but also not harm the patient as they quit smoking and draw themselves into relapse.
